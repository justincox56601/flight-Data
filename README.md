# flight-Data
a simple web app that pulls flight data from an API and puts it in a database

Intro To Databases is the propername for this directory.  This will hold all of the modules I create for this class/project

uses MVC design pattern to keep everything ecanpsulated
uses a singleton pattern for database security
uses prepared statements for sql security
uses cURL to connect to the API

This version is not commplete.  the following will be added in the future
1) A graphing libary in javascript sothe data can be visualized.
2) A proper CSS / SCSS pass
3) Connect to the CRON object so the data can be pulled automatically on a schedule
